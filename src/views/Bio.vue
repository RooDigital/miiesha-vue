            From the small Aboriginal community of Woorabinda in Central Queensland comes a 21 year old with a voice ready to be heard.
            <br><br>
            A strong, Anangu/Torres Strait Islander woman, Miiesha (Pronounced My-ee-sha) has been singing for her family and her community since the age of 8, and has since been developing her songwriting as a teenager. Now stepping onto a bigger stage, Miiesha is sharing her music with the world.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by the sounds of RnB, Gospel and Soul, and the power of spoken word poetry, Miiesha’s music seeks to bring people together to help educate and inspire.
            <br><br>
            Gifted with a voice that showcases vulnerability and strength, often in the one breath, Miiesha sings of her people and her community with the words of a leader and a teacher.
            <br><br>
            Having supported the likes of Baker Boy, Briggs, Adrian Eagle and Thelma Plum as well as performing at Vanfest and Laneway Festival, Miiesha is using her voice and her message to bring her community to the world.
            <br><br>

Since making her debut in mid-2019, Miiesha has released a string of mesmerising singles – ‘Black Privilege’, ‘Drowning’, ‘Twisting Words’ and ‘Hold Strong’. These songs later came together as part of her fearless debut album ‘Nyaaringu’, which was one of 2020’s most affecting and critically lauded albums, nominated for five ARIA awards including Best Female and Breakthrough Artist Miiesha won the Best Soul/R&amp;B ARIA award.
