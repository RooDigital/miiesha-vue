            <i>"Miiesha holds multitudes - she is a movement" - Cyclone Wehner - NME</i>
            <br><br>
            <span>From the small Aboriginal community of Woorabinda Miiesha arrived on the RnB landscape with a sound and a story that instantly demanded attention.
            <br><br>
            A strong, proud Anangu/Torres Strait Islander woman, Miiesha (Pronounced My-ee-sha) released her debut collection of songs entitled Nyaaringu in 2020. Meaning 'what happened' in Pitjantjatjara language, Nyaaringu explores the stories and the strength Miiesha has inherited from her late Grandmother, whose interludes narrate the project.
            <br><br>
            Since its release, Nyaaringu has not only garnered critical acclaim, but received the 2020 ARIA for Best Soul/RnB Release, a QLD Music Award, a NIMA, and went on to top multiple Album of the Year lists.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by the sounds of RnB, Gospel and Soul, and the power of spoken word poetry, Miiesha is using her music to bring people together to help educate and inspire.
            <br><br>
            With a voice that showcases vulnerability and strength, often in the one breath, Miiesha sings of her people, her community and her story with the raw emotion of lived experience.
            <br><br>
            Miiesha's story is not just worth hearing, it's needed.</span>
